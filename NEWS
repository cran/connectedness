# Time-stamp: <2006-08-08 03:27:20 ggorjan>
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2006-08-?? version 0.2-1
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o NA's in either x or y are not removed by default, but only when
  drop=TRUE. Subset method gains dropNA=NULL argument due to
  this. Now subset arguments are properly placed after '...'. 2006-08-08

o Added unit tests. 2006-08-08

o Removed connectedness.package.Rd as it is not really needed
  here. 2006-08-08

o LGPL -> GPL. 2006-06-17

o Removed dependency on package RColorBrewer since this was not really
  needed. I needed RColorBrewer only to get a set of default distinct
  colors. 2006-06-17

  them. 2006-05-02

o Subset slot in output of connectedness can be ommited; subset
  appropriately modified. 2006-05-02

  separate arguments for plot, polygons, points and lines are
  possible. Additionaly argument set added to plot. 2006-05-02
