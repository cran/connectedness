# Time-stamp: <2007-03-04 12:47:40 ggorjan>
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o Upload to CRAN. [2007-03-04]

o codetools seems to be happy - "only parameter ‘x’ changed by assignment"
  warnings. [2007-03-04]

# 2007-03-03 version 0.2.2
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o Update RWiki and my local website. [2007-03-03]

o Passes R CMD check on R 2.5.0 Under development (unstable) (2006-12-06
  r40129). [2007-03-03]

o Removed bug in calculation of percentages per subset in case of NA
  values. [2007-03-03]

o Removed bug in list names in output from levelsBySet - found it after
  previous bug was removed. [2007-03-03]

o Removed bug due to ordering of subsets with sort=TRUE - subset names were
  changed only in one place. Now they are not changed at all and therefore
  consistent through the whole output object. [2007-03-03]

o Added vignette and minor documentation fixes. [2007-03-03]

o Name changes. Argument set to subset in plot.connectedness(),
  levelsBySubset() and subset.connectedness(), while subset in
  connectedness() bacomes subsetData. Function levelsBySet() becomes
  levelsBySubset(). Sorry :( [2007-03-03]

o Now on SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/projects/r-ggorjan/
  [2006-11-03]

o Passes R CMD check on R 2.4.0 (small fix) and R-devel. [2006-10-31]

o x.y.z version numbering. [2006-10-08]

o Added import (due to is) to NAMESPACE & DESCRIPTION. Passes R CMD check
  of R 2.3.1 and R 2.5.0. [2006-09-10]

o Removed return() where applicable, reduced number of <- in some
  places. codetools pointed to some unused objects and to one hidden bug
  related to unused objects in recycling in plot method; all files under
  version control. [2006-09-10]

o Small changes in generation of messages for stop(). [2006-08-19]

o Added is.connectedness(). [2006-08-19]

o Added R wiki page to URL field in DESCRIPTION. [2006-08-11]
  http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:connectedness

# 2006-08-09 version 0.2-1
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o NA's in either x or y are not removed by default, but only when
  drop=TRUE. Subset method gains dropNA=NULL argument due to
  this. Now subset arguments are properly placed after '...'. [2006-08-08]

o Added unit tests. [2006-08-08]

o Removed connectedness.package.Rd as it is not really needed
  here. [2006-08-08]

o LGPL -> GPL. [2006-06-17]

o Removed dependency on package RColorBrewer since this was not really
  needed. I needed RColorBrewer only to get a set of default distinct
  colors. [2006-06-17]

o Only unique levels are printed out in Levels* columns. [2006-06-06]

o Percent in form of 33 and not 0.33. [2006-06-06]

o Minor documentation fixes - typos etc. [2006-05-02]

# 2006-05-02 version 0.2
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o Levels of both factors are stored in ret$sets. Argument factor added to
  levelsBySet to print levels of both factors or only one of
  them. [2006-05-02]

o Subset slot in output of connectedness can be ommited; subset
  appropriately modified. [2006-05-02]

o Complete reorganization in arguments for plot.connectedness(). Now
  separate arguments for plot, polygons, points and lines are
  possible. Additionaly argument set added to plot. [2006-05-02]

o Added arguments lines and linesSet to plot.connectedness() to draw lines
  between connected cells. [2006-05-01]

# 2006-04-30 version 0.1
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o Initial version 0.1.
